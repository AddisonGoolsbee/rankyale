# RankYale

Rank Yale is a website for ranking the popularity of students at Yale University. Not meant to be taken too seriously, though if you want to opt out from being ranked, there's a button in the header for it.

My name is Addison Goolsbee and I have too much time on my hands.

## Development

Run the project with `npm run dev`
`npm run build` and `npm run preview` to test as a static site
`npm run build` and `npm run deploy` to deploy on github pages
